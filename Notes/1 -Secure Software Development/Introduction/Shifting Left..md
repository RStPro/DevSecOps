Security can now be easily integrated because of the visibility and flexibility that DevOps introduces. You might have heard of the concept "Shifting Left".

This means that  DevOps teams focus on instilling security from the earliest stages in the development life-cycle and introducing a more collaborative culture between development and security.

Since security can now be introduced early, risks are reduced massively. In the past, you would find out about security flaws and bugs at the very late stages, even in production. Therefore leading to stress, rollbacks, and economic losses. Integrating code analysis tools and automated tests earlier in the process can now identify these security flaws during early development.

Shifting Left

In the past, security testing was implemented at the end of the development cycle. As the industry evolved and security functions were introduced, security teams would perform various analyses and security testing in the final stages of the lifecycle. 

Depending on the results of security testing, it would either permit the application to proceed for deployment into production or reject the application and pass it back to developers for remediating the flaws identified. This resulted in long delays in development and friction between teams.  

Implementing security measures during all stages of the development lifecycle (shifting left) rather than at the end of the cycle will ensure the software is designed with security best practices built in. By detecting security flaws early in development, remediation costs are lower, and there would be no need to roll back changes as they are being addressed on time. This reduces cost, builds trust, and improves the security and quality of the product.  

Why are we shifting left

Back in the day, before agile, developers would request infrastructure from IT and receive servers weeks or months later. Nowadays, this provisioning of infrastructure in the cloud is automated. This shift has improved development productivity and speed. However, this increased velocity can also spark security concerns and lead to flaws that can go unnoticed.

The Shift-Left approach ensures these flaws are caught early by introducing processes from the start. In this fast-paced environment, post-development security reviews of new software versions or analysis of cloud infrastructure configurations become a bottleneck. Even when problems are discovered, there is not enough time to remediate them before the next version or feature is introduced. To keep up with customer needs, they need a fast-paced environment for scaling and growth. Security is at risk of being left behind; instilling security in the beginning and adapting security testing to become flexible and adapted to the development life-cycle increases the chances of addressing things promptly.

This development approach to shifting left in DevOps can be referred to as **DevSecOps.**

Yes, you heard it right. With DevOps, security gets introduced early in the development cycle, which minimizes risks massively. Integrating code analysis tools and automated tests earlier can lead to better identification and elimination of security loopholes. And as the software gets to the deployment stage, everything works smoothly as anticipated. Security is not an add-on. It's a must-have design feature. Blending security in DevOps would enhance the impact of DevOps and eliminate a lot of other bottlenecks that could arise otherwise. With a rise in the frequency of cyber threats and tightening regulations, adding security to DevOps is not a choice now but certainly an obligation.
