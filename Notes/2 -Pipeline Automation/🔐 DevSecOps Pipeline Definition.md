A **DevSecOps pipeline** is an automated software delivery workflow that integrates **security practices** into every phase of the **DevOps lifecycle** â€” from **code development** to **deployment and operations**.

The goal is to build, test, and release software quickly **while ensuring security is a shared responsibility** across development, operations, and security teams.

### ðŸ“¦ Key Components of a DevSecOps Pipeline

1. **Plan**
    - Security requirements defined early (e.g., threat modeling, compliance needs).
    - Tools: Jira, Confluence, OWASP Threat Dragon.

2. **Develop**
    - Secure coding practices enforced.
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
    - Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, ESLint.

3. **Build**
    - Secure build environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
    - Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to detect vulnerable libraries.
    - Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check.

4. **Test**
    - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
    - Container and API security scanning.
    - Tools: ZAP, Burp Suite, Trivy.

5. **Release**
    - Security gates enforced (e.g., block vulnerable builds).
    - Secrets detection and scanning.
    - Tools: GitLab CI/CD, HashiCorp Vault.

6. **Deploy**
    - Infrastructure is deployed securely with access controls and encryption.
    - Kubernetes security scanning and policy enforcement.
    - Tools: Terraform, Open Policy Agent (OPA), Aqua Security.

7. **Operate**
    - Continuous monitoring and logging.
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and anomaly detection.
    - Tools: Wazuh, Falco, Prometheus, Grafana.

8. **Monitor**
    - Feedback loops for incident response and improvement.
    - SIEM integration for proactive alerting.
    - Tools: Splunk, ELK Stack.

### âœ… Goals of a DevSecOps Pipeline

- **Shift security left**: Embed security early in the SDLC.
- **Automate security checks**: Reduce human error and delays.
- **Ensure compliance**: Meet standards like ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS.
- **Reduce vulnerabilities**: Catch issues before production.
- **Promote collaboration**: Unite developers, security, and ops.
