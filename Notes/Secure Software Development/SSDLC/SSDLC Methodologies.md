You can follow different methodologies to integrate security in the SDLC best. Before we dive into each method., regardless of the chosen development methodology (Agile, DevOps, Extreme Waterfall, etc.), there is a need to:

- Build with security in mind
- Introduce testing focused on security

There are several methodologies for SDLC; some examples of widely used methodologies are:

- Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
- OWASP Secure Software Development Life Cycle Project (S-SDLC)
- Software Security Touchpoints

## Microsoft's SDL

#### SDL principles:

- Secure by Design: Security is a built-in quality attribute affecting the whole software lifecycle.
- Security by Default: Software systems are constructed to minimise potential harm caused by attackers, e.g. software is deployed with the least necessary privilege.
- Secure in Deployment: software deployment is accompanied by tools and guidance supporting users and administrators.
- Communications: software developers are prepared for occurring threats by communicating openly and timely with users and administrators

SDL is a collection of mandatory security activities grouped by the traditional software development lifecycle phases. Data is collected to assess training effectiveness. In-process metrics are used to confirm process compliance. Post-release metrics are used to guide future changes. SDL places heavy emphasis on understanding the cause and effect of security vulnerabilities. A development team must complete the mandatory security activities to comply with the Microsoft SDL process. You can implement SDL by following these practices:

Regardless of the development methodology being used, must continually update security requirements to reflect changes in required functionality and changes to the threat landscape.                                                                                                                                         |

Defining these early helps a team understand risks associated with security issues, identify and fix security defects during development, and apply the standards throughout the entire project.                                                                                                                   |

|                        Establish Design Requirements                         | The SDL is typically thought of as assurance activities that help engineers implement "secure features", in that the features are well-engineered concerning security. Engineers will normally rely on security features, such as cryptography, authentication, logging, etc. In many cases, the selection or implementation of security features has proven so complicated that design or implementation choices are likely to result in vulnerabilities. Therefore, it's crucially essential to apply these consistently and with a consistent understanding of their protection. |

Encryption is typically used to achieve this. E.g., only use industry-vetted encryption libraries and ensure they're implemented to allow them to be easily replaced if needed.                                                                                              |
|           Manage the Security Risk of Using Third-Party Components           |                                                                                                         When selecting third-party components to use, it's essential to understand the impact of a security vulnerability on the security of the more extensive system into which they are integrated. Having an accurate inventory of third-party components and a plan to respond when new vulnerabilities are discovered will go a long way toward mitigating this risk.                                                                                                         |

Engineers should strive to use the latest version of approved tools, such as compiler versions, and take advantage of new security analysis functionality and protections.                                                                                                                                      |

The same goes for performing run-time verification of your fully compiled or packaged software checks functionality that is only apparent when all components are integrated and running.                                                                                                          |

As such, the test typically finds the widest variety of vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                                                             |

## OWASP's S-SDLC  

#### S-SDLC Principles

- SDL is a collection of mandatory security activities grouped by the traditional software development lifecycle phases.
- Data is collected to assess training effectiveness.
- In-process metrics are used to confirm process compliance.
- Post-release metrics are used to guide future changes.
- SDL places heavy emphasis on understanding the cause and effect of security vulnerabilities.
- A development team must complete the sixteen mandatory security activities to comply with the Microsoft SDL process.

OWASP S-SDLC aims to build "security quality gates", to support quality and secure software made throughout the pipeline.
This is done by following an Agile Security approach, where sprints are dedicated to security.
Examples of Sprints can include: Code reviews, authentication, authorisation, input validation, and assessing technical risks like code injections.
The gates comprise sprints focusing on similar building blocks like those seen in Microsoft SDL.

OWASP S-SDLC Agile approach is heavily influenced and based on a "Maturity Model" approach, in particular OWASP SAMM.
The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organisations formulate and implement a software security strategy tailored to the organisation's specific risks.
It helps to evaluate an organisation's existing software security practices, build a software security assurance program, demonstrate improvements to that program, and define and measure security activities for an organisation. SAMM helps explain objectives, actions, results, success metrics, costs etc.

An example would be a security scorecard for gap analysis, for instance, in a particular area, like endpoint protection. It aims to answer "How well are we doing and where do we want to get to?". [OWASP SAMM link](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/)

Another critical security model is the Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM). BSIMM is a study of real-world software security initiatives and reflects the current state of software security.

BSIMM can be described as a "measuring stick" to understand your security posture by providing a comparison of other companies' security states. In other words, it does not tell you what you should do but rather what you are doing wrong. There are hundreds of organisations involved. [BSIMM link](https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/10/29/comparing-bsimm-and-samm/)
