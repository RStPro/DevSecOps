The Software Development Lifecycle is a set of practices that make up a framework to standardise building software applications. SDLC defines the tasks to perform at each software development stage.

This methodology aims to improve the quality of the software and the development process to exceed customer expectations and meet deadlines and cost estimates. For example, with customer demand, computing power increases, which raises software costs and developer dependence. SDLC provides a way to measure and improve the development process by providing insights and analysing each stage, maximising efficiency and reducing costs.  

How does SDLC work?

The Software Development Life Cycle provides the guidance required to create a software application. It does this by splitting these tasks into phases that form the Software Development Lifecycle. Standardising the tasks within each phase increases the efficiency of the development process. Each phase divides into granular tasks that can be measured and tracked. This introduces the capability of monitoring to ensure projects stay on track. The aim of SDLC is to establish repeatable processes and predictable outcomes from which future projects can benefit. SDLC phases are usually divided into 6-8 phases.

The set of phases are:

- **Planning**: The planning phase encompasses all aspects of project and product management. This includes resource allocation, project scheduling, cost estimation etc.
- **Requirements** **Definition**: is considered part of planning to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. For example, a social media application would require the ability to connect with a friend.  
- **Design** **& Prototyping**: establishing how the software application will work, programming language, methods to communicate with each other, architecture etc
- **Software Development:** entails building the program, writing code and documentation.
- **Testing:** In this phase, we ensure components work and can interact with each other. For example, each function works correctly, different parts of the application work seamlessly together, and performance-wise, there are no lags in processing etc. 
- **Deployment:** in this stage, the application or project is made available to users.
- **Operations & Maintenance:** this is where engineers respond to issues in the application or bugs and flaws reported by users and sometimes plan additional features in future releases.

Companies can choose to rearrange by splitting or unifying these into 6-8 phases. For example, we can merge the testing phase with the Development phase in scenarios where security is introduced in every development step, as developers fix bugs during testing. It can depend on the Software Development Model; software development has evolved, as seen in the [Intro To DevSecOps](https://tryhackme.com/jr/introductiontodevsecops) room. SDLC models include Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps, amongst others.
