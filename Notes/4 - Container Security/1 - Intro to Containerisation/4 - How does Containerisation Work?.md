Namespaces essentially segregate system resources such as processes, files and memory away from other namespaces.  

Every process running on Linux will be assigned two things:  

- A namespace
- A process identifier (PID)

Namespaces are how containerisation is achieved! Processes can only "see" other processes that are in the same namespace - no conflicts in theory. Take Docker, for example, every new container will be running as a new namespace, although the container may be running multiple applications (and in turn, processes).

Put simply, the process with an ID of 0 is the process that is started when the system boots. Process numbers increment and must be started by another process, so naturally, the next process ID will be #1. This process is the systems `init` , for example, the latest versions of Ubuntu use `systemd`. Any other process that runs will be controlled by `systemd` (process #1).

We can use process #1's namespace on an operating system to escalate our privileges. Whilst containers are designed to use these namespaces to isolate from each other, they can instead coincide with the host computer's processes... This gives us a nice opportunity to escape!
